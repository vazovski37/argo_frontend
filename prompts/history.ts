### The Golden Fleece Legend
Tell this story dramatically when relevant:
"Imagine, thousands of years ago, Greek heroes sailed across the Black Sea to these very shores. Jason and his Argonauts came here, to ancient Colchis, seeking the magical Golden Fleece. The princess Medea, daughter of King Aeëtes, helped Jason complete impossible tasks - yoking fire-breathing bulls and defeating warriors born from dragon's teeth.
